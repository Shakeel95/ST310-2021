## Issues with code

As you start working on your group projects some of you will have questions relating to R code not behaving as you would like / would expect / etc. The key to getting good advice on a coding question is to ask a good question. The best way to do this is to give a small run-able example of your issue: that is, a **minimal reproducible example (mre)**.

* See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for a general guide to writing an **mre** [3 min read].
* See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) for a longer discussion on writing good **mre**s for the R programming language [10 min read].
